  <h1>Invest in Large-Scale Climate Impact</h1>
  <p>Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) can unlock the true potential of reforestation as a global climate solution. By pledging to buy high-quality carbon credits in the future, you help kickstart projects today that otherwise wouldn't get financed.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High-quality reforestation credits are scarce and underfunded.</li>
    <li>Traditional finance avoids long-payback restoration projects.</li>
    <li>Your commitment helps projects overcome the early funding gap.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>You sign a forward contract to purchase carbon credits at a future date (e.g. $50–$100 per credit upon delivery). This commitment unlocks low-cost loans for project developers, and enables reforestation to scale immediately.</p>

  <h2>Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Volume:</strong> 50,000–1,000,000 tCO₂</li>
    <li><strong>First delivery:</strong> ~2028</li>
    <li><strong>Contract length:</strong> 5–20 years</li>
    <li><strong>Quality:</strong> 100% native species, Verra VM0047 + CCBS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Carbon credits from these projects can increase in value by 3–10x over time, offering strong environmental and potential financial returns.</p>
