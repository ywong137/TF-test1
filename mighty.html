    <h1>Advance Market Commitments for Forest Restoration</h1>

    <p>Reforestation is one of the most powerful climate solutions available today. It’s fast, scalable, and cost-effective—but it’s chronically underfunded, especially at the early stages when capital is most needed.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>High-quality reforestation credits are scarce: less than 3% of annual carbon credit demand is met by high-quality restoration projects on Verra.</li>
      <li>Restoration projects face high upfront costs and long timelines—often 5+ years before revenue.</li>
      <li>Traditional finance avoids these risks due to lack of collateral, long payback periods, and lower returns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
    <p>Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) unlock stalled reforestation projects by committing capital now for future delivery of carbon credits. This derisks early-stage financing and sends a strong demand signal to the market.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You commit today</strong> to purchase carbon credits from future reforestation projects at a fixed price.</li>
      <li><strong>We use your commitment</strong> to unlock low-cost loans and begin planting trees now.</li>
      <li><strong>You pay later</strong>—typically upon delivery of the verified credits (starting ~2028).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Deal Parameters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Commitment Size:</strong> $500,000 – $5,000,000</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Volume:</strong> 5,000 – 100,000 tCO₂</li>
      <li><strong>Price per Credit:</strong> $50–$100, depending on project type and term</li>
      <li><strong>Contract Term:</strong> 5–10 years (short) or 20+ years (long-term)</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery Start:</strong> ~2028</li>
      <li><strong>Project Types:</strong> Native high-biodiversity forests, agroforestry, blue carbon (mangroves)</li>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Verra VM0047 + CCB Standards, 100% native species, community co-benefits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Climate and Financial Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each credit represents 1 ton of CO₂ removed and stored long-term</li>
      <li>Projects offer over 40 years of permanence</li>
      <li>Early-stage credits can appreciate 3–10x in market value over time</li>
    </ul>
